cards
=====
Design a class (or classes) to represent playing cards
 ------------------------------------------------------
A playing card may be a standard card or a joker.
 A standard card has a suit which is: Heart, Diamond, Spade or Club.
 A standard card has a value which is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King or Ace.
 A joker has no suit.
 You should provide a suitable constructor for a card.
 A card object should be able to print a representation of itself, in the form: "Ace of Hearts", "7 of Spades", "King of Diamonds", etc.
 
Define a means of checking the value-equivalence of cards
 ---------------------------------------------------------
Write a function which decides if two cards are equivalent.
Two cards are equivalent if they have the same value, or if either of the cards is a joker. EXECUTING
 
A SINGLE-PLAYER GAME OF PELMANISM
===========================================
 Next, write a program that simulates a one-player game of Pelmanism ('Pairs'), with your program as the player.
 
Generate a pack of cards
 ------------------------
A pack of cards comprises each of the thirteen values (2, 3... King, Ace) in each of the four suits - plus two jokers.
 
 Shuffle the cards
 -----------------
 Shuffle your 54 cards into a reasonably random order.
 
 Pick as many pairs as you can find
----------------------------------
When played by a human with real cards, all the cards are face-down. The player picks pairs randomly, one card at a time. If the two cards are equivalent, they can be removed and placed in the bank. If they are not equivalent, they are put back where they came from, face-down.
 Decent players will remember the value of previously-seen unmatched cards - so if the player picks a 7 and a 9, they won't match - but later, when he/she picks a new pair and the first card is a 7, he/she will remember that another 7 has been seen in a different location, and pick that to form a matching pair.
